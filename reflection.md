# Reflection

## Advice to self if I do a project like this again
- Keep the code organized from the beginning, having messy code is harder to change later
- Have a written down and pretty much set in stone plan so that the rest of the progression for the project may run smoothly

## Hardest part of the project
- The hardest part of this project was the movement of the grid based game and making the sprite interact with the objects around the room.
- Another hard part was integrating the projects I had done previously into this one, as we learned more things as we went along the course.

## Did you complete the needs to have list?
- I completed pretty much everything in the need to have list, including the score added to my interactive scene, the health and the score for the avoid falling objects game, etc.

## Most proud of
- The part of this project that I am most proud of is the rock paper scissors minigame, because of how simple yet fun of a game it is.
